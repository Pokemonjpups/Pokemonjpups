## Hewwo **OwO**

I'm decently proficient in Javascript, Typescript, and Lua. I'm currently learning/playing around with Go and C#. I like to make bots, web apps, and Roblox games.

One open source project I'm working on often is [2012-roblox](https://github.com/pokemonjpups/2012-roblox), which is a web app designed to copy Roblox's website from the early 2012 era.
